# Shoots-Ladders

A shoots and ladders game and one of my first C++ Programs.
You can make an automatic game or a manual game (where you can set all the variables : number of tiles, number of players, number of s and l tiles and their respective values).
snakes.cpp is the main and you need it and all the headers for it to run.
